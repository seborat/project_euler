The Odin Project -- JavaScript 101

Problem 1: This was trickier than I thought. I had to look at some student solutions. Most solutions made a funtion where any number (not just 1000) could be entered. I had been focusing on just making it for multiples of 3 and 5 under 1000.

Problem 2: I felt I had a better approach to this problem (I understood it better) but I could not generate a solution. I had 2 different approaches, with different fibonacci algorithms but neither worked. I looked at solutions which made sense, but I couldn't figure out why mine wouldn't work. Very frustrating. 
	edit: found the issue. I forgot an equal sign when declaring "fib=[]" variable. There are no words to describe this kind of stupid.
